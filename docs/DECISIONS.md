# Decisions

Simplest option that satisfies the spec, per CLAUDE.md.

## Stage 0
- **Contract additions beyond SPEC §7** (needed by console/customer screens, added before the freeze): `GET /handoffs`, `GET /deal-packets`, `GET /alerts`, `PATCH /alerts/{id}`, `GET /sessions`, `POST /customers/{id}/recommendation/review`. Entities added: `Session`, `Opportunity`, `TimingPlan`, `FairnessReport`, `AuditEntry`, `StudioAgent`, `DeployResult`, `Dealer`.
- **Customer embeds vehicle + contract.** One contract per customer keeps the persona flows simple.
- **Advisor answers are JSON, not a stream.** K3 can animate the text client-side; SSE can be added later as a new endpoint without breaking the contract.
- **Pydantic models are generated** from `openapi.yaml` (`pnpm gen`), so the API can't drift from the contract.
- **Mocks are TypeScript, not JSON**, so `tsc` checks every fixture against the generated types. One shared `handlers.ts` serves both apps.
- **Console pages render generically in Stage 0** from `lib/nav.ts` (title + endpoints). C1–C4 replace each with the real screen.
- **Kiosk idle reset** remounts the screen (re-blurring every number) and resets language to English. Sign-out comes with K1 sign-in.
- **Framer Motion / GSAP / R3F not installed yet**: added in the stage that first uses them (K1, K4).
- **Python 3.12 via uv**; Node 24, pnpm 10.

## Stage C1 (console)
- **Generic route is now `app/[...slug]`** (was optional catch-all) so `app/page.tsx` can own `/`; real routes (`/queue`, `/customers`, `/customers/[id]`) win over the catch-all.
- **TanStack Table v8**, not v9: v8 is the shadcn data-table pattern; v9's API differs.
- **Equity on Customer 360 comes from the recommendation's scenarios** (`Scenario.equity`); `Customer` has no equity field and the console computes no numbers.
- **Risk bands** (Low < 30%, Medium < 60%, High) are display-only thresholds on `risk_score`.
- **Queue filters** are situation, priority and a text search over name, ID, model and reason; the `/customers` page uses the API's `?q=` search.
- **Console strings are English-only for now**; console i18n comes with a later C stage.

## Stage K1 (customer app)
- **Signed-in customer lives in `?id=CUST-…`** on `/app` and `/kiosk`. That URL is also the QR deep link, so there's no auth state to store. Sign-out (and the kiosk's 60s idle reset) goes back to the bare path, which shows sign-in. IDs are upper-cased, and `CUST-` is added if it's missing.
- **No camera QR scanning** in K1: the phone's own camera opens the deep link. `BarcodeDetector` isn't available on desktop Safari or Firefox, so it would need a fallback anyway.
- **Demo persona buttons** (Maria, James, Priya) on sign-in, for the dealership demo. All data is synthetic.
- **The three steps (Situation → Next move → Why this) are client state**, not routes, so the kiosk remount resets them for free.
- **The recommendation action button isn't wired yet.** The action center is K2.
- **Engine copy (headline, labels, why, assumptions) stays English** until the Advisor returns localized text (B3). Everything in the UI around it is EN/ES.
- **Kiosk blur covers every dollar figure**, including the why text, why-not reasons and assumptions (each one is its own tap). APR and miles stay visible.
- **A Guardian `block` verdict hides the recommendation** and shows "a specialist is reviewing".
